## Sample apps
The WinObjC sample apps can be found in */Apps*. They include:
- [**ToDoList**](/Apps/ToDoList)

  A simple to do list app created for a [Building Apps for Windows tutorial blog post](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/01/20/building-a-simple-app-with-the-windows-bridge-for-ios/).

- [**Calculator**](/Apps/Calculator)

  A simple, Storyboard/Auto Layout-based calculator app created for a [Building Apps for Windows tutorial blog post](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/02/18/using-the-ios-bridge-to-bring-storyboards-and-auto-layout-to-windows-10/).

## Example code
Sample code and projects for common scenarios can be found under */Scenarios*. They include:
